This package exposes ipython jupyter notebooks as callable functions which can be used in python programs or scripts and parameterized externally.

The goal is to provide a simple way to reuse code developed/maintained in a notebook environment.

## Installation

```bash
> pip install NotebookScripter
```

## How to use

Suppose you have this notebook: [./Example.ipynb](./Example.ipynb). You can use the NotebookScripter.run_notebook method to execute it.

```pycon

>>> from NotebookScripter import run_notebook
>>> some_module = run_notebook("./Example.ipynb")
>>>
```

The call to `run_notebook()`:

1. creates an anonymous python module
1. execs all the code cell's within `Example.ipynb` sequentially in the context of that module
1. returns the module after all the cells have executed.

Values or functions defined in the module scope within the notebook can be subsequently accessed:

```pycon
>>> print(some_module.some_useful_value)
You can access this variable on the module object returned from run_notebook
>>> some_module.hello("world")
Hello world
>>>
```

The `run_notebook` execution model matches the mental model that a developer has when working within the notebook. Importantly - the notebook code is _not_ imported as a python module - rather, all the code within the notebook is re-run on each call to run_notebook() just as a developer would expect when working interactively in the notebook.

If desired, values can be injected into the notebook for use during notebook execution by passing keyword arguments to `run_notebook`.

```pycon
>>> another_module = run_notebook('./Example.ipynb', a_useful_mode_switch="idiot_mode")
Hello Flat Earthers!
>>>
```

Within the notebook, use the `NotebookScripter.receive_parameter` parameter to receive parameters from the outside world.

```python
a_useful_mode_switch = receive_parameter(a_useful_mode_switch=None)
```

In this call -- `a_useful_mode_switch` is passed to run_notebook as a keyword parameter which causes receive_parameter(a_useful_mode_switch=None) to return `"idiot_mode"` rather than `None`.

`receive_parameter` requires a single keyword argument. If a matching keyword argument was supplied to run_notebook then that value is returned from `receive_parameter()` otherwise the provided value is returned. This api ensures all parameters have default values allowing the notebook to be used interactively or with parameters supplied externally.

## Dealing with matplotlib

`run_notebook` supports an argument `with_backend` which defaults to 'agg'. `run_notebook` registers its own handler for `%matplotlib` ipython line magic which replaces the argument in the cell with the value supplied to run_notebook. For example -- suppose you had a jupyter cell with contents like the following:

```pycon
%matplotlib inline

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# ...<some script that also produces plots>...
```

When executed via run_notebook(..., with_backend='agg') - the line `%matplotlib inline` will instead be interpreted like `%matplotlib agg`.

This functionality allows 'interactive' plotting backend selection in the notebook environment and 'non-interactive' backend selection in the scripting context. 'agg' is a non-interactive backend built into most distributions of matplotlib. To disable this functionality provide `with_backend=None`.

## Execute a notebook in isolated subprocess

`run_notebook` executes notebook's within the same process as the caller. Sometimes more isolation between notebook executions is desired or required. NotebookScripter provides a run_notebook_in_process function for this case:

```pycon
>>> from NotebookScripter import run_notebook_in_process

# run notebook in subprocess -- note there is no output in doctest as output occurs in subprocess
>>> module = run_notebook_in_process("./Example.ipynb", mode={"a_useful_mode_switch": "idiot_mode"})
>>>
```

Unlike `run_notebook`, `run_notebook_in_process` cannot return the module as Python modules are not transferrable across process boundaries. It's still possible to retrieve serializable state from the notebook though. Return values can be retrieved by passing the 'return_values' parameter. After executing the notebook, variables from the module scope matching the names passed will be serialized, transferred from the subprocess back to the calling process, deserialized, and an anonymous module with those names/values will be returned to the caller. All requested values must be pickle serializable (otherwise, their repr() will be returned).

```pycon
>>> module = run_notebook_in_process("./Example.ipynb", mode={"a_useful_mode_switch": "non_idiot_mode"}, return_values=["some_useful_value"])
>>> print(module.some_useful_value)
You can access this variable on the module object returned from run_notebook
>>>
```

## Use run_notebook on notebooks imported into VSCode

VSCode supports an integrated [jupyter workflow](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/pythonengineering/2018/11/08/python-in-visual-studio-code-october-2018-release/).

1. Install the Microsoft Python VSCode extension -- https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python
1. Open a .ipynb file in vscode and choose to 'Import Jupyter Notebook'. This will convert the .ipynb file into a .py file by extracting the text contents of the cells.

You now have your notebook represented as a text file which is editable in vscode. VSCode represents the division between cells with special comment:
`# %%`
and can execute cells with 'Run Cell' or keybindings. You can also launch the notebook in the vscode debugger.

What you can't do is reasonably reuse this imported code from another python module. You very probably designed your code to run well inside notebook's with code executing in module scope and running as a side effect of import. Rather than importing your .py module from other code what you want is a way to _invoke_ it -- which you can use `run_notebook()` to do.

`run_notebook` supports .py files and executes them with the same (nearly the same) semantics as would have been used to run the equivalent code in a .ipynb file. You should also be able to use the debugger within files executed via `run_notebook`.

## Why

A friend of mine was working on a complex analysis for her PhD thesis in an ipython jupyter notebook. She was reasonably familiar with the jupyter workflow -- which by design, tends to force you into defining parameters/state as module globals where they can be easily accessed from subsequent cells. She organized her notebook nicely, with plots and various forms of sanity checking for a complicated and hairy chain of computations that took a long time to run. Sometime near when she was finished designing the analysis, she realized she would need to run this notebook a few hundred times with different values for the parameters which she had discovered controlled the dynamics for her problem. I'm fond of typed languages and expected this would be relatively easy to refactor so IÂ leaned in to help when I heard her groan. I quickly realized -- in fact -- no, this refactor would not be so simple.

- Python is extremely difficult to refactor - even relatively simple mechanical transformations are essentially rewrites in terms of required debugging time
- Code written in the workflow of jupyter notebooks tends to be even harder still to reorganize. The notebook workflow encourages you to define variables and parameters on the module scope so that you have easy access to these values from other cells. In fact -- one of the _reasons_ notebook's are convenient to use is precisely this implicit sequential chaining. The code in the notebook is linear -- things defined in later cells depend on _anything_ defined before which often makes extracting arbitrary parameters into normal code reuse units like functions a pretty major change to the logic of the notebook.
- Normal code reuse abstractions like functions often make it _harder_ to read, reason about, and deal with your notebooks interactively. In many cases, its much simpler to write as much of your process linearly as you can -- with all the parameters in scope given values describing a single instance of the problem so that you can inspect and edit interactively at any relevant point in the process rather than hiding code inside function scopes which cannot be so readily inspected/modified interactively
- Extracting the code from the notebook and turning it into a form that allows normal parameterization _loses_ some of the simplicity of the original process description. If she discovers after refactoring her code an unexpected issue that occurs when processing one of the hundreds of variations of parameters -- its not going to be possible to go back and investigate with her process and all the intermediate computation states -- she will have been forced to rewrite her code in a way that makes it hard or impossible to take advantage of the interactive computing model.

Refactoring her code to run all the problem instances for her analysis within the notebook would be error prone, make the notebook harder to interact with, and make the notebook harder to read by a reader trying later to understand the process. ThisÂ kind of refactoring reduces the benefits and conveniences of notebooks (ease of interacting with intermediate computation states, code-as-documentation) vs the single-long-linear process description style more suitable for interactive development.

## Comparison to other methods

_nbconvert_ - allows one toÂ do a one-time conversion from .ipynb format to a .py file. It does the work of extracting code from the .ipynb format. This is useful but doesn't directly extract re-runnable 'work flows' from the typical sequences of instructions one would interactively define on the notebook module scope. Typically one would have to change the code output by nbconvert to make use of it in a script or program -- and those chnages would turn that code into a form that was less useable for interactive development.

_vscode's vscode-python_ - performs a conversion to a .py like nbconvert and then also provides a jupyter notebook like development flow on top of raw .py files with various advantages over the .ipynb format (editors, revision control). The VSCode plugin _also_ allows you to re-export your .py output back to .ipynb files for convenient sharing/publishing. The functionality provided by vscode-python is great -- but similar to _nbconvert_ code imported from a notebook is likely to need a lot of change before it can be re-used -- and the changes required are very likely to make the code _no longer_ work well with a notebook development mindset.

_NotebookScripter_ allows one to directly invoke notebook code from scripts and applications without having to extensively change the way the code is written. You can keep code in a form that is tailored for interactive use within a notebook, continue to develop and interact with that code with a notebook workflow and easily invoke that notebook from python programs or scripting contexts with externally provided parameters if needed. Notebook files themsevles can be encoded as either jupyter .ipynb files or as vscode-python or nbconvert style .py files.
